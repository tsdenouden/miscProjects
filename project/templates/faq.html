                Your work/progress is saved locally in your browser via cookies when you click the save button.

                However, your work is also saved to actual files so it can be shown, downloaded, updated, etc. 
                Unlike cookies, these files are temporary and are automatically deleted when you close the tab 
                or if they're more than a day old.

            <li>
                To download your work, scroll to the bottom of the editor
                and find the download button. Choose which file format 
                you'd like and just press download.

        <ul class="p-5" style="list-style: disc;">
            <li>
                Next to the download button, there is a label that says "Markdown file (.md)",
                click it and a dropdown menu will pop up with a list of formats
                for you to choose from.

            I downloaded an HTML file. Why is there no theme?

                Download the CSS file if you'd like to keep
                the theme/styling. Both files (HTML & CSS) have to be in the same 
                folder for the theme to be applied (or you could rewrite the 
                location of the css stylesheet in the HTML file).
            </li>
            <li>
                However, if you have downloaded the CSS file and you've
                made sure it's in the right folder, double check if the 
                file name hasn't been altered in any way.

                File names are altered automatically from repeated downloads:
                E.g "123456.CSS (1)" instead of "123456.CSS"

                To get around this, I recommend finding a website to host your images on

                If you know HTML, a simpler way is to download your project as
                an HTML file and edit the src in the img tags.
