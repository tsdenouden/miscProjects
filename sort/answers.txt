sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: I ran sort1 on quite a few times per text file and it always seemed to average around ~0.300ms (real time) for the most part,
                  according to my observations, this was the slowest algorithm.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Just like sort1, I ran sort2 quite a few times per text file and the average was ~0.090ms,
                                   lightning fast compared to the other two algorithms, this led me to believe this was Merge Sort.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: sort3 had the second fastest average time of ~0.150ms according to my findings, was quite a bit faster or close to sort1
                  but not nearly as fast as sort2.
